## Documentation for Business Card

Major technologies I used while making this was HTML, CSS, @ keyframes, codepen code, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Visual Studio Code. @ keyframes was used to show animation in the icons for a hover state as well as the animated colors behind the card containers. Adobe Illustrator was used to create most of the vector based graphics on the cards. Adobe Photoshop was used to modify the background images used on both the cards and the site background.

## Major Accomplishments/Challenges

 Major accomplishments in this project was finally getting the icons (instagram, email, and internet) to respond to animation in the CSS. Finally getting the rotating glowing lights to work was also a great accomplishment, getitng them to fit behind the cards individually to be specific.
